Pre-requisites
=========================================
1. Apache maven 3.0.3 (I have not tested this using the previous version of maven)
2. JDK 1.6.0_26 but JDK 1.5+ should be fine 
3. 3rd Party libraries found in the pom.xml. Everything should be downloadable over the internet

Design Patterns
==========================================
1. Producer - Consumer Design Pattern 
   - Allows task processing as soon as it gets the the task queue.
   - Producer blocks when the queue is full, consumer blocks when the queue is empty
   - Does not depend on the task queue to be built first before consumer can do its work
   
2. Mediator Design Pattern - Facilitates the communication between the producer and the consumer
   - Decouples the producer and the consumer. The one does not know the presence of the other.
   
Design Considerations
===========================================

1. The producer - consumer design pattern
   The idea here is that, we would like to process the task as soon as it gets to the queue
   
2. Hashing Function
   Used to determine whether an image has changed or not. In the future, the 
   same hashing function can be used to determine whether 2 or more files of different file names 
   are equally the same
